# Exploring-Trends-and-Predictive-Insights-in-Crown-Prosecution-Service-Case-Outcomes
This project presents a comprehensive data analytics workflow focused on crime outcome data using R. It encompasses full-cycle data processing, starting with data integration and cleaning, followed by in-depth descriptive analytics, where meaningful trends and patterns were visualised across offence types and timeframes. The study then progressed to predictive modelling, implementing and comparing four regression, clustering, and classification algorithms to identify the most accurate and interpretable models. Each modelling task was supported by hypothesis testing, feature selection, and statistical validation such as MANOVA and Chi-square tests. Insights derived from the models were critically evaluated with real-world implications for judicial decision-making, such as resource allocation and conviction outcome prediction. Advanced visualisations, including heatmaps, time-series decompositions, and confusion matrices, were used to effectively communicate findings. The project concludes with a critical review of the tools and methods employed, supported by academic literature. This demonstrates strong technical, analytical, and critical thinking skills relevant to data science roles.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises criminal case outcomes collected from the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) across multiple regions and time periods (2016â€“2018). It includes detailed monthly offence statistics across various categories such as homicide, burglary, robbery, sexual offences, drugs, fraud, and motoring offences. For each offence type, the dataset records both the number of convictions and unsuccessful outcomes, along with their corresponding percentages.
Each record is associated with a specific geographical area and month, enabling spatiotemporal analysis. The dataset contains over 1,100 rows and 50+ columns after integration, covering both numerical and categorical data. Through feature engineering, additional fields such as total crime cases, conviction rates, and derived time variables (month, year) were generated to support advanced modelling.
This dataset is highly suitable for descriptive, predictive, and inferential analytics to uncover trends, assess judicial performance, and support strategic decision-making in the criminal justice domain.
